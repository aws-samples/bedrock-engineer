scenarios:
  - title: Simulating a Damped Harmonic Oscillator
    content: >-
      I need to visualize a damped harmonic oscillator with different damping coefficients. Could you create a Python
      simulation that shows the position vs time graphs for underdamped, critically damped, and overdamped cases? I'd
      like to understand how the energy dissipates in each scenario.
  - title: Quantum Wave Packet Evolution
    content: >-
      Can you help me simulate and visualize the time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet in a 1D infinite square well
      using the Schrödinger equation? I'd like to see how the probability distribution changes over time and understand
      the quantum mechanical behavior.
  - title: Electric Field Visualization
    content: >-
      I'm trying to understand electric fields better. Could you create a visualization of the electric field around
      multiple point charges in 2D space? I'd like to see both the field lines and a color map of the field strength for
      different charge configurations.
  - title: N-body Gravitational Simulation
    content: >-
      I'm interested in celestial mechanics. Can you create an N-body simulation of a small solar system with a star and
      several planets? I'd like to see how their orbits evolve over time and understand the stability of the system.
  - title: Statistical Mechanics of Ideal Gas
    content: >-
      Could you simulate the behavior of an ideal gas using a Monte Carlo approach? I'd like to verify the
      Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and see how macroscopic properties emerge from microscopic interactions at
      different temperatures.
  - title: Analyzing Experimental Data
    content: >-
      I have this CSV file with experimental data from a pendulum experiment. The columns are time, angle, and angular
      velocity. Could you help me analyze this data to extract the pendulum's length and damping coefficient, and then
      create a model that matches the experimental results?
  - title: Relativistic Particle Motion
    content: >-
      I'm trying to understand special relativity better. Could you simulate and visualize the trajectory of a charged
      particle in a magnetic field at different speeds, including relativistic effects? I'd like to see how the path
      changes as the particle approaches the speed of light.
  - title: Fluid Flow Simulation
    content: >-
      Can you create a 2D simulation of fluid flow around an obstacle using the Navier-Stokes equations? I'd like to
      visualize the velocity field, pressure distribution, and vorticity for different Reynolds numbers.
