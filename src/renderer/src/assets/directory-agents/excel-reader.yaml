  4. Create new sheets or tables as needed


  **Data Processing Considerations:**

  - Always use absolute paths for file paths (utilizing {{projectPath}})

  - Specify ranges accurately in Excel format ("A1:C10")

  - Set `showFormula: true` when formula display is needed

  - Set `showStyle: true` when style information is needed



  ## Response Format


  Excel file analysis results are provided in a structured format, clearly explaining the meaning and relevance of the
  data. Processing procedures are shown step by step, with detailed explanations of the purpose and results of each
