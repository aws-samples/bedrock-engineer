# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Client Integration

Model Context Protocol (MCP) client integration allows Bedrock Engineer to connect to external MCP servers and dynamically load and use powerful external tools. This integration extends the capabilities of your AI assistant by allowing it to access and utilize the tools provided by the MCP server.

## What is Model Context Protocol?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized interface that allows AI assistants to interact with external tools and services. It provides a way for language models to access capabilities beyond their built-in functions, such as:

- Specialized data processing
- External API integrations
- Custom tool implementations
- Domain-specific functionality

## Benefits of MCP Integration

Integrating MCP clients with Bedrock Engineer offers several advantages:

1. **Extended Capabilities**: Access tools beyond what's built into Bedrock Engineer
2. **Dynamic Tool Loading**: Add new tools without application updates
3. **Specialized Functionality**: Incorporate domain-specific tools for particular use cases
4. **Custom Integrations**: Connect to your organization's internal systems and APIs
5. **Community Ecosystem**: Leverage tools developed by the broader community

## Configuring MCP Client Integration

To set up MCP client integration:

1. Navigate to the Settings section in Bedrock Engineer
2. Select the "MCP Integration" tab
3. Configure the connection to your MCP server:
   - Server URL
   - Authentication credentials (if required)
   - Connection parameters
4. Test the connection to verify it's working properly
5. Enable specific tools from the connected MCP server

## Setting Up an MCP Server

You can set up your own MCP server to provide custom tools. For detailed information about MCP server configuration, see the [MCP Server Configuration Guide](../../mcp-server/MCP_SERVER_CONFIGURATION.md).

The basic steps include:

1. Setting up an HTTP server that implements the MCP protocol
2. Defining the tools you want to provide
3. Implementing the tool functionality
4. Configuring authentication and security
5. Deploying the server where Bedrock Engineer can access it

## Using MCP Tools in Agent Chat

Once configured, MCP tools will appear alongside built-in tools in the Agent Chat interface:

1. Open Agent Chat
2. Select your agent
3. Configure tools through the tools panel
4. MCP-provided tools will be listed with their source indicated
5. Enable the desired MCP tools
6. The agent can now use these tools in conversations

## Tool Discovery and Documentation

When connecting to an MCP server, Bedrock Engineer will:

1. Query the server for available tools
2. Download tool definitions and documentation
3. Present tools with their descriptions, parameters, and usage information
4. Allow selective enabling of individual tools

## Security Considerations

When using MCP integration:

- **Server Trust**: Only connect to MCP servers from trusted sources
- **Data Privacy**: Be aware of what data is sent to external MCP servers
- **Authentication**: Use appropriate authentication mechanisms
- **Network Security**: Ensure secure connections between Bedrock Engineer and MCP servers
- **Permission Management**: Carefully control which MCP tools are enabled

## Advanced Usage

### Tool Chaining

MCP tools can be chained together with built-in tools to create powerful workflows:

1. Use a built-in tool to gather information
2. Process that information with an MCP tool
3. Use the results with another built-in tool

### Custom Tool Development

You can develop your own MCP tools:

1. Implement the tool following MCP specifications
2. Deploy the tool on your MCP server
3. Connect Bedrock Engineer to your server
4. Configure your agent to use the custom tools

### Organization-Wide Tool Sharing

MCP integration enables sharing specialized tools across your organization:

1. Develop tools for specific business needs
2. Deploy them on a central MCP server
3. Have team members connect to the shared server
4. Everyone benefits from the collective tool development

## Troubleshooting

Common issues with MCP integration:

- **Connection Failures**: Check network connectivity and server URL
- **Authentication Issues**: Verify credentials and permissions
- **Tool Availability**: Ensure the server is correctly advertising its tools
- **Performance Problems**: Consider network latency and server capacity
- **Version Compatibility**: Verify MCP protocol version compatibility

## Examples of MCP Tool Usage

- **Database Connectors**: Tools to query specific database systems
- **Internal API Access**: Tools that interface with your organization's APIs
- **Specialized Analyzers**: Domain-specific analysis tools
- **Custom Generators**: Tools that create content in specialized formats
- **Legacy System Integration**: Tools that interface with existing enterprise systems
