# Amazon Bedrock Integration

Bedrock Engineer's Agent Chat integrates deeply with Amazon Bedrock services, providing a range of powerful AI capabilities. This document details the various Bedrock integration tools available.

## Available Bedrock Integration Tools

### generateImage

Generates images using Amazon Bedrock LLMs.

- Uses stability.sd3-5-large-v1:0 by default
- Supports both Stability.ai and Amazon models
- Supports specific aspect ratios and sizes for Titan models
- Outputs images in PNG, JPEG, and WebP formats
- Allows seed specification for deterministic generation
- Supports negative prompts to exclude specific elements

**Example Use Cases**:
- Generating UI mockups and design concepts
- Creating diagrams and illustrations for documentation
- Visualizing concepts described in text
- Producing custom imagery for projects

### recognizeImage

Analyzes images using Amazon Bedrock's image recognition capabilities.

**Analysis Types**:
- Object detection
- Text detection
- Scene understanding
- Image captioning

**Features**:
- Processes images from local files
- Provides detailed analysis results
- Can be used for content moderation
- Enhances accessibility features
- Supports automated tagging
- Enables visual search applications

### generateVideo

Generates videos using Amazon Nova Reel.

**Features**:
- Creates realistic, studio-quality videos from text prompts or images
- Supports multiple modes:
  - TEXT_VIDEO (6 seconds)
  - MULTI_SHOT_AUTOMATED (12-120 seconds)
  - MULTI_SHOT_MANUAL
- Returns immediately with job ARN for status tracking
- Requires S3 configuration

### checkVideoStatus

Checks the status of video generation jobs.

**Features**:
- Uses invocation ARN to retrieve status
- Returns current status, completion time, and S3 location
- Monitors progress of video generation jobs
- Determines when videos are ready for download

### downloadVideo

Downloads completed videos from S3.

**Features**:
- Uses invocation ARN to identify the video
- Automatically retrieves S3 location from job status
- Downloads to specified local path or project directory
- Should only be used when checkVideoStatus shows status as "Completed"

### retrieve

Searches information using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Base.

**Features**:
- Retrieves relevant information from specified knowledge bases
- Enhances agent responses with domain-specific knowledge
- Supports multiple knowledge base sources
- Provides source attribution for retrieved information

### invokeBedrockAgent

Interacts with specified Amazon Bedrock Agents.

**Features**:
- Initiates dialogue using agent ID and alias ID
- Uses session ID for conversation continuity
- Provides file analysis capabilities for various use cases
- Supports Python code analysis
- Enables chat functionality with specialized agents

### invokeFlow

Executes Amazon Bedrock Flows for custom data processing pipelines.

**Features**:
- Supports agent-specific flow configurations
- Handles multiple input data types:
  - String
  - Number
  - Boolean
  - Object
  - Array
- Enables automation of complex workflows
- Allows customized data processing sequences
- Provides flexible input/output handling
- Ideal for data transformation and multi-step processing
- Integrates with other AWS services

## Configuration Requirements

To use Bedrock integration tools, you'll need:

### AWS Credentials

- Valid AWS credentials with appropriate permissions
- Access to Amazon Bedrock services in your AWS account
- IAM roles configured for Bedrock access

### Service-Specific Requirements

- **Image/Video Generation**: Appropriate model access in Bedrock
- **Knowledge Base**: Pre-configured knowledge bases in Amazon Bedrock
- **Bedrock Agents**: Properly set up agents with appropriate aliases
- **Flows**: Configured flow definitions in your account

### Storage Configuration

- S3 bucket configuration for video generation and storage
- Appropriate permissions for S3 access

## Best Practices

### Cost Management

- Monitor usage of generative features (image/video)
- Use appropriate model sizes for your needs
- Consider batching related tasks
- Be aware of pricing for different model types

### Performance Optimization

- Pre-configure knowledge bases with relevant information
- Use specific, clear prompts for image and video generation
- Structure flow inputs properly for consistent results
- Consider response times when chaining multiple services

### Security Considerations

- Follow AWS best practices for credential management
- Restrict permissions to necessary services only
- Be cautious about the information shared with external models
- Consider data residency requirements for your use case

## Integration Examples

### Knowledge-Enhanced Agents

Combining `retrieve` with agent interactions allows creation of domain-specific assistants with access to proprietary knowledge bases.

### Visual Content Creation Workflow

A complete workflow might involve:
1. Using agent to generate image concepts
2. Generating images with `generateImage`
3. Analyzing results with `recognizeImage`
4. Creating video animations with `generateVideo`
5. Downloading and incorporating videos into projects

### Agentic RAG Applications

Building retrieval-augmented generation applications by:
1. Creating knowledge bases with domain-specific data
2. Using `retrieve` to access relevant information
3. Processing and presenting that information in context

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Access Denied**: Check IAM permissions for Bedrock services
- **Model Unavailable**: Verify model availability in your region
- **Generation Failures**: Refine prompts and check for content policy violations
- **Knowledge Base Issues**: Ensure knowledge bases are properly indexed and accessible
